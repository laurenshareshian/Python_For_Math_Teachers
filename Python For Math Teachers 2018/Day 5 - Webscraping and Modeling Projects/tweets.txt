 we. . only reason the hacking of the poorly defended dnc is discussed is that the loss by the dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed! intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results.  voting machines not touched! gross negligence by the democratic national committee allowed hacking to take place. the republican national committee had strong defense! happy birthday @erictrump!  the terrible situation in florida.  just spoke to governor scott.  thoughts and prayers for all.  stay safe! i am asking the chairs of the house and senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with nbc prior to me seeing it. anna wintour came to my office at trump tower to ask me to meet with the editors of conde nast & steven newhouse, a friend.  will go this am. being a movie star-and that was season 1 compared to season 14.  now compare him to my season 1.  but who cares, he supported kasich & hillarywow, the ratings are in and arnold schwarzenegger got sw or destroyed by comparison to the ratings machine, djt.  so much for. hopefully, all supporters, and those who want to make america great again, will go to d. c.  on january 20th.  it will be a great show! and knew they were in big trouble - which is why they cancelled their big fireworks at the last minute. they saw a movement like never beforehillary and the dems were never going to beat the passion of my voters.  they saw what was happening in the last two weeks before thethe dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the great wall for sake of speed, will be paid back by mexico later! so how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers?  what is going on? the democratic national committee would not allow the fbi to study or see its computer info after it was supposedly hacked by russiahow did nbc get an exclusive look into the top secret report he obama was presented?  who gave them this report and why?  politics! toyota motor said will build a new plant in baja, mexico, to build corolla cars for u. s.  no way!  build plant in u. s.  or pay big border tax. to make up their own minds as to the truth.  the media lies to make it look like i am against intelligence when in fact i am a big fan! the dishonest media likes saying that i am in agreement with julian assange - wrong.  i simply state what he states, it is for the people. time for republicans & democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works - much less expensive & far better! do the typical political thing and blame.  the fact is obamacare was a lie from the beginning. keep you doctor, keep your plan!  it is. the democrats, lead by head clown chuck schumer, know how bad obamacare is and what a mess they are in.  instead of working to fix it, they. . jackie evancho's album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her inauguration performance. some people just don't understand the movementmassive increases of obamacare will take place this year and dems are to blame for the mess.  it will fall of its own weight - be careful! like the 116% hike in arizona.  also, deductibles are so high that it is practically useless.  don't let the schumer clowns out of this webrepublicans must be careful in that the dems own the failed obamacare disaster, with its poor coverage and massive premium increasesthings they did and said like giving the questions to the debate to h.  a total double standard!  media, as usual, gave them a pass. somebody hacked the dnc but why did they not have hacking defense like the rnc has and why have they not responded to the terriblethank you to ford for scrapping a new plant in mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the u. s.  this is just the beginning - much more to follow@foxnews: julian assange on u. s.  media coverage: ‚Äúit‚Äôs very dishonest. ‚Äù #hannity  more dishonest than anyone knowsjulian assange said a 14 year old could have hacked podesta - why was dnc so careless?  also said russians did not give him the info! the intelligence briefing on so-called russian hacking was delayed until friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case.  very strange! i will be having a general news conference on january eleventh in n. y. c.  thank you. trump is already delivering the jobs he promised america  should be no further releases from gitmo.  these are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield. instead of driving jobs and wealth away, america will become the world's great magnet for innovation & job creation.  ford to scrap mexico plant, invest in michigan due to trump policies be, their number one act and priority.  focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance!  #dtswith all that congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the independent ethics watchdog, as unfair as itthe democrat governor. of minnesota said the affordable care act obamacare is no longer affordable!  - and, it is lousy healthcare. people must remember that obamacare just doesn't work, and it is not affordable - 116% increases arizona.  bill clinton called it crazygeneral motors is sending mexican made model of chevy cruze to u. s.  car dealers-tax free across border.  make in u. s. a. or pay big border tax! china has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the u. s.  in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with north korea.  nice! north korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the u. s.  it won't happen! i thought and felt i would win big, easily over the fabled 270 306.  when they cancelled fireworks, they knew, and so did i. various media outlets and pundits say that i thought i was going to lose the election.  wrong, it all came together in the last week and. . @cnn just released a book called unprecedented which explores the 2016 race & victory.  hope it does well but used worst cover photo of me!

really sad that republicans would allow themselves to be used in a clinton ad.  lindsey graham, romney, flake, sass.  supreme court, remember! wow, hillary clinton was so insulting to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people.  i think it will cost her at the polls!

final poll results from nbc on last nights commander-in-chief forum.  thank you!  #imwithyou #maga  wasn't matt lauer that hurt hillary last night.  it was her very dumb answer about emails & the veteran who said she should be in jail. more poll results from last nights commander-in-chief forum.  #americafirst #trumptrain  nights results - in poll taken by nbc.  #americafirst #imwithyou  luis, mexico and the united states would have made wonderful deals together - where both mexico and the us would have benefitted. mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who i know is highly respected by president pe√±a nieto. hillary clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past.  she is totally confused.  unfit to serve as #potus. hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night.  she's being decimated by the media!

!  vote for trump ! ! @chernuna: @realdonaldtrump it defies belief the web of lies hillary is spinning!  one excuse after another.  then it's this, then it's that. lyin' hillary clinton told the fbi that she did not know the c markings on documents stood for classified.  how can this be happening? to the african-american community: the democrats have failed you for fifty years, high crime, poor schools, no jobs.  i will fix it, vote tthe polls are close so crooked hillary is getting out of bed and will c tomorrow. why did she hammer 13 devices and acid-wash e-mails? the great state of arizona, where i just had a massive rally amazing people, has a very weak and ineffective senator, jeff flake.  sad! the republican party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as @jeffflake, if it is going to stop illegal immigration. rt @danscavino: doesn't fit the msm narrative - so they wont share what @realdonaldtrump did for jesse jackson in 1999 - so i will!   @realdonaldtrump @cnn cnn is so biased.  never ever watch them.  trump 2016! ! crooked hillary's v. p.  pick said this morning that i was not aware that russia took over crimea.  a total lie - and taken over during o term! wow, the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on crooked's fbi release.  they are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source. @cnn is so disgusting in their bias, but they are having a hard time promoting crooked hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals. great visit to detroit church, fantastic reception, and all @cnn talks about is a small protest outside.  inside a large and wonderful crowd!

   that african-americans are seeing what a bad job hillary type policy and management has done to the inner-cities, they want trump! crooked hillary's brainpower is highly overrated. probably why her decision making is so bad or, as stated by bernie s, she has bad judgementdoes anyone know that crooked hillary, who tried so hard, was unable to pass the bar exams in washington d. c.  she was forced to go elsewhere@pmnorlando: @realdonaldtrump i know of no one voting for crooked hillary!

hillary clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays & refuses to speak out against radical islam. hillary, whose decisions have led to the deaths of many, accepted $ from a business linked to isis.  silence at cnn.   hillary clinton is 100% owned by her donors.  #imwithyou #maga  you columbus, ohio!  i will be back soon.  #imwithyou #maga  you oklahoma & virginia!  #makeamericagreatagain #imwithyou  believe cnn these days almost as little as they believe hillary. that's really saying something! the people who support hillary sit behind cnn anchor chairs, or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life. will cnn send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt hillary? when will we see stories from cnn on clinton foundation corruption and hillary's pay-for-play at state department? cnn anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs. cnn will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for hillary clinton. join governor mike pence in reno, nevada- tonight at 7pm!  tickets available at:   with all of the obama tough talk on russia and the ukraine, they have already taken crimea and continue to push.  that's what i said! when i said in an interview that putin is not going into ukraine, you can mark it down, i am saying if i am president.  already in crimea! this story is not about mr.  khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather radical islamic terrorism and the u. s.  get smart! mr.  khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the dnc and is now all over t. v.  doing the same - nice! wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us.  the failing @nytimes is a joke.  @cnn is laughable! @realjameswoods:  without absolutely owning the liberal media, hillaryclinton wouldn't stand a chance.  #voterfraud and #msm her only hope. the dishonest media is fawning over the democratic convention.  i wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than crooked h? i was viciously attacked by mr.  khan at the democratic convention.  am i not allowed to respond?  hillary voted for the iraq war, not me! captain khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about radical islamic terror and the weakness of our leaders to eradicate it! nielson media research final numbers on acceptance speech: trump  32. 2 million.   clinton 27. 8 million.   thank you! thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the republican national convention #1 over crooked hillary and dems. can you imagine if i had the small crowds that hillary is drawing today in pennsylvania.  it would be a major media event!  @cnn @foxnewsnato commander agrees members should pay up via @dcexaminer: nato's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must pay their bills.  this is a general i will like! the rust belt was created by politicians like the clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like mexico.  end! crooked's stop in johnstown, pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with bill, vp#crookedhillary = obama's third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below.   is that crooked hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in pennsylvania.  perhaps it is because her husband signed nafta? i turned down a meeting with charles and david koch.  much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better! why doesn't the media want to report that on the two big thursdays when crooked hillary and i made our speeches - republican's won ratings#crookedhillary  hillary clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes.  a formula for disaster! violent crime is rising across the united states, yet the dnc convention ignored it.  crime reduction will be one of my top priorities. just got back from colorado.  the love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible.  big crowds! while i am in oh & pa - you can also join @mike_pence in nevada on mon! carson city: reno:  me monday in columbus, ohio & harrisburg, pennsylvania!  #maga3pm in oh: 7pm in pa:  homeownership rate in q2 2016 was 62. 9% - lowest rate in 51yrs.  we will bring back the  'american dream! '  are suffering through the worst long-term unemployment in the last 70 years.  i want change - crooked hillary clinton does not. hillary can never win over bernie supporters.  her foreign wars, nafta/tpp support & wall street ties are driving away millions of votes. colorado was amazing yesterday!  so much support.  our tax, trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to colorado and the whole country. @patrioticpepe: @realdonaldtrump only trump can unite america and fix obama's mistakes! ! !  #trump2016  you denver, colorado!  #makeamericagreatagain!   usual, hillary & the dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major nfl games.  same as last time w/ bernie.  unacceptable! #crookedhillary job application  clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement & insticts. thank you to the amazing law enforcement officers in colorado! #makeamericagreatagain #lesm  you colorado springs.  get out & vote #trumppence16 in november!   a reagan or a trump-like figure in the white house will achieve this goal.   bill is tired of the lies, sad!   me in colorado springs at 2pm- or in denver tonight at 7pm! colorado springs: denver:  bernie sanders really thinks of crooked hillary clinton.   am watching crooked hillary speak.  same old stuff, our country needs change! wow, my c is hearing from more and more bernie supporters that they will never support crooked hillary.  she sold them out, v. p.  pick! in hillary clinton's america - things get worse.  #trumppence16  dishonest media didn't mention that bernie sanders was very angry looking during crooked's speech.  he wishes he didn't make that deal! thank you!  facebook: instagram:   hillary said that i couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political c really,i just beat 16 people and am beating her! if michael bloomberg ran again for mayor of new york, he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town!   #neverhillarylittle michael bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me.  his last term as mayor was a disaster! general john allen, who i never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against isis.  his record = bad  #neverhillarycrooked hillary clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech.  many of her statements were lies and fabrications! join @mike_pence at the university of northwestern ohio- tonight at 7pm.  tickets:  i believe in science dem code for we're shutting down coal mines, steel plants and any other remaining manufacturingc statement:  policemen just shot in san diego, one dead.  it is only getting worse.  people want law and order! crooked hillary clinton made up facts about me, and forgot to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream! the media coverage this morning of the very average clinton speech and convention is a joke.  @cnn and the little watched @morning_joe = sad! no one has worse judgement than hillary clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes. hillary's wars in the middle east have unleashed destruction, terrorism and isis across the world. hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety. hillary will never reform wall street.  she is owned by wall street! our way of life is under threat by radical islam and hillary clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words. hillary's refusal to mention radical islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country. departing now - thank you cedar rapids, iowa.  this is a movement!    warn not to underestimate trump's potential win to be back in iowa!  #tbt with @jerryjrfalwell joining me in davenport- this past winter.  #maga  household income is down for the middle class since obama took office.  it will only go further down under clinton. a vote for clinton-kaine is a vote for tpp, nafta, high taxes, radical regulation, and massive influx of refugees. america's future caved!

mi: wi:  one american flag on the massive stage at the democratic national convention until people started complaining-then a small one.  patheticour not very bright vice president, joe biden, just stated that i wanted to carpet bomb the enemy.  sorry joe, that was ted cruz! crooked hillary clinton wants to flood our country with syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about.  the danger is massive.  no! hopefully the violent and vicious killing by isis of a beloved french priest is causing people to start thinking rationally.  get tough! the democratic convention has paid zero respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country.  no recognition - sad! funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing dems narrative that russia is working for me because putin said trump is a genius.  america 1st! as i have been saying, crooked hillary will approve the job killing tpp after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv. just like i have warned from the beginning, crooked hillary clinton will betray you on the tpp.   of bernie's supporters have left the arena.  did bernie go home and go to sleep? i hate to say it, but the republican convention was far more interesting with a much more beautiful set than the democratic convention! no matter what bill clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible.  highly overrated! you have no idea what my strategy on isis is, and neither does isis a good thing.  please get your facts straight - thanks.  @megynkellyfor the record, i have zero investments in russia. in order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the wikileakes disaster, the dems said maybe it is russia dealing with trump.  crazy! dems don't want to talk isis b/c hillary's foreign interventions unleashed isis & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here. bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed! the invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for crooked hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar! thank you new h #makeamericagreatagain  us in toledo, ohio- tomorrow night at 8pm!  #trumppence16 #magatickets:   us tomorrow in scranton, pennsylvania at 3pm! #trumppence16 #maga tickets:   bombed last night!  sad to watch. why aren't the democrats speaking about isis, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order.  the republican convention was greatfunny, if you listen to @foxnews, the democrats did not have a good day.  if you listen to the other two, they are fawning.  what a differencebernie sanders totally sold out to crooked hillary clinton.  all of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it!  waste of time. elizabeth warren, often referred to as pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about crooked hillary, who she always hated! sad to watch bernie sanders abandon his revolution.  we welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs. if cory booker is the future of the democratic party, they have no future!  i know more about cory than he knows about himself. i was at @foxnews and met juan williams in passing.   he asked if he could have pictures taken with me.  i said fine.  he then trashes on air! hard to believe that bernie sanders has done such a complete fold.  he got nothing for all of the time, energy and money.  the v. p.  a joke! while bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers. clinton betrayed bernie voters.  kaine supports tpp, is in pocket of wall street, and backed iraq war. thank you ohio!  #trumppence16  you roanoke, virginia- be back soon!  #trumppence16  america safe and great again!  #trumppence16    poll numbers are coming out all over.  people don't want another four years of obama, and crooked hillary would be even worse.  #magathe state of florida is so embarrassed by the antics of crooked hillary clinton and debbie wasserman schultz that they will vote for change! wow, the republican convention went so smoothly compared to the dems total mess.  but fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn! here we go again with another clinton scandal, and e-mails yet can you believe.  crooked hillary knew the fix was in, b never had a chance! crooked hillary clinton knew everything that her servant was doing at the dnc - they just got caught, that's all!  they laughed at bernie. if bernie sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same. thank you!  #makeamericagreatagain  was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened! how much bad judgement was on display by the people in dnc in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against bernie! the new joke in town is that russia leaked the disastrous dnc e-mails, which should never have been written stupid, because putin likes mewatched crooked hillary clinton and tim kaine on 60 minutes.  no way they are going to fix america's problems.  isis & all others laughing! the ratings for the republican national convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great.  thank you! the highly neurotic debbie wasserman schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a crooked hillary victory, she's out! the democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing!  e-mails say the rigged system is alive & well! even though bernie sanders has lost his energy and his strength, i don't believe that his supporters will let crooked hillary off the hook! crooked hillary clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, dws.  too bad bernie flamed outif the republican convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player.  bernie, media would go wildthe @cnn panels are so one sided, almost all against trump.  @foxnews is so much better and the ratings are much higher.  don't watch cnn! i always said that debbie wasserman schultz was overrated.  the dems convention is cracking up and bernie is exhausted, no energy left! today proves what i have always known, that @reince priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not debbie wasserman shultz @dwstweets. sorry folks, but bernie sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer.  he is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and dnc disrespect.  sad! there is no longer a bernie sanders political revolution.  he is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end! an analysis showed that bernie sanders would have won the democratic nomination if it were not for the super delegates. looks like the bernie people will fight.  if not, their blood, sweat and tears was a total waste of time.  kaine stands for opposite! wow, president obama's brother, malik, just announced that he is voting for me.  was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else! bernie sanders started off strong, but with the selection of kaine for v. p. , is ending really weak.  so much for a movement!  total disrespectthe crooked hillary v. p.  choice is very disrespectful to bernie sanders and all of his supporters.  just another case of bad judgement by h! #makeamericagreatagain#trumppence16  @realdonaldtrump dinesh d'sousa hillary's america.  see it@olimauritania: @realdonaldtrump kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals  #hillarykaine2016thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on thursday night.  from the heart! the wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud! just saw crooked hillary and tim kaine together.  isis and our other enemies are drooling.  they don't look presidential to me! i will bring jobs back and get wages up.  people haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years.  clinton killed jobs! tim kaine has been praising the trans pacific partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved.  job killer! funny that the democrats would have their convention in pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs.  i will bring jobs back! crooked hillary clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in pennsylvania.  against steelworkers and miners.  husband signed nafta. leaked e-mails of dnc show plans to destroy bernie sanders.  mock his heritage and much more.  on-line from wikileakes, really vicious.  riggedpocahontas wanted v. p.  slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the senate.  also, crooked hillary hates her! tim kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks.  bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice.  bernie fought for nothing! the bernie sanders supporters are furious with the choice of tim kaine, who represents the opposite of what bernie stands for.  philly fight? @theresa_cali: @realdonaldtrump general michael flynn will make a great secretary of defense when you become potus!  #makeamericasafeagaini highly recommend the just out book - the field of fight - by general michael flynn.  how to defeat radical islam. is it the same kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while governor of virginia and didn't get indicted while bob m did? another attack, this time in germany.  many killed.  god bless the people of munich. one of the best produced, including the incredible stage & set, in the history of conventions.  great unity!  big t. v.  ratings!  @karlrovethank you cleveland.  we love you and will be back many times! what a great four days in cleveland.  so proud of the great job done by the rnc and all.  the police and secret service were fantastic! make america safe and great again!  #rncincle acceptance of the nomination!  #trumppence16  can watch 360 video live from the podium!   #rncincle #trumpiswithyou #makeamericagreatagainthis is a movement!  #rncincle  you @donaldjtrumpjr.  proud of you!  #rncincle #trumppence2016  job @ivankatrump!  #rncincle than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses, the party is very united.  great love in the arena! ted cruz talks about the constitution but doesn't say that if the dems win the presidency, the new justices appointed will destroy us all! i am soooo proud of my children, don, eric and tiffany - their speeches, under enormous pressure, were incredible.  ivanka intros me tonight! great job @erictrump!  proud of you! #americafirst #rncincle  america great again!   was packed, totally electric! . @mike_pence was fantastic tonight.  will be a great v. p. our next vice president of the united states of america, gov.  @mike_pence! #gopincle #gopconvention#americafirst  ted cruz got booed off the stage, didn't honor the pledge!  i saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway.  no big deal! great job @erictrump!  proud of you!  #americafirst #rncincle  you @scottwalker!  #americafirst #rncincle  you to governor @scottwalker for such warm support.  great speech! thank you @ingrahamangle!  #americafirst  #rncincle  the #gopconvention#americafirst #rncinclejohn kasich was never asked by me to be v. p.  just arrived in cleveland - will be a great two days! statement on melania speech media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of melania's speech than the fbi spent on hillary's emails. good news is melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press! in november, i think the people of ohio will remember that the republicans picked cleveland instead of going to another state.  jobs! bill hemmer of @foxnews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena.  more than in past years. congratulations to my children, don and tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night.  i am very proud of you! such a great honor to be the republican nominee for president of the united states.  i will work hard and never let you down!  america first! the roll call is beginning at the republican national convention.  very exciting! #makeamericaworkagain #trumppence16 #rncincle  #trumppence16 #rncincle    democrats are coming to trump.  i used to be proud of the dem party.  no more it is crooked and not for the people. it was truly an honor to introduce my wife, melania.  her speech and demeanor were absolutely incredible.  very proud!  #gopconventionwill be on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:30pm @foxnews- prior to melania's speech at the #gopconvention.  tune in- she will do great!  #rncincle#makeamericasafeagain! #gopconvention #rncincle   other than low ratings @cnn have been very fair and exciting! . @cnn is the worst. they go to their dumb, one-sided panels when a podium speaker is for trump!  vast majority want: make america great again! looking forward to being at the convention tonight to watch all of the wonderful speakers including my wife, melania.  place looks beautiful! thank you mahoning county, ohio!  see you soon!  #makeamericasafeagain   @foxandfriends: still ahead: @realdonaldtrump joins us at 7am/et!  #rncincle  obama just had a news conference, but he doesn't have a clue.  our country is a divided crime scene, and it will only get worse! our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching.  we are not looking good, we are not looking smart, we are not looking tough! @60minutes: donaldtrump and his running mate @mike_pence to appear on #60minutes in first joint interview.  cbs  will be on @60minutes tonight at 7:00 p. m.  with mike pence talking about law and order and many other subjects!  bad times for divided usa! we are trying to fight isis, and now our own people are killing our police.  our country is divided and out of control.  the world is watchingwe grieve for the officers killed in baton rouge today.  how many law enforcement and people have to ratings at @foxnews blow away the ratings of @cnn - not even close.  that's because cnn is the clinton news network and people don't like. @foxnews is much better, and far more truthful, than @cnn, which is all negative.  guests are stacked for crooked hillary!  i don't watch. if goofy elizabeth warren, a very weak senator, didn't lie about her heritage being native american she would be nothing today.  pick her hi hope that crooked hillary picks goofy elizabeth warren, sometimes referred to as pocahontas, as her v. p.  then we can litigate her fraud! it doesn't matter that crooked hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made.  bernie said she has bad judgement! as the days and weeks go by,  we see what a total mess our country and world is in - crooked hillary clinton led obama into bad decisions! we are going to have a great time in cleveland.  will lead to special results for our country.  we will make america great again! goofy elizabeth warren, who may be the least productive senator in the u. s.  senate, must prove she is not a fraud.  without the con it's overthank you to jack morgan, tamara neo, cheryl ann kraft and all of my friends and supporters in virginia.  great job! @trumpdoonbeg: great news!  we've been nominated for ireland's best golf hotel 2016. we would appreciate your vote!   you to chris cox and bikers for trump - your support has been amazing.  i will never forget.  make america great again! thank you!  #trumppence16  hillary clinton is bought and paid for by wall street, lobbyists and special interests.  she will sell our country down the tubes! very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes, crooked hillary clinton, can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money! crooked hillary, who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies, has been a disaster on foreign policy.  look what's happening! crooked hillary is spending big wall street money on ads saying i don't have foreign policy experience, yet look what her policies have donelook forward to introducing governor mike pence who has done a spectacular job in the great state of indiana.  my first choice from start! look forward to governor mike pence v. p.  introduction tomorrow in new york city. i am pleased to announce that i have chosen governor mike pence as my vice presidential running mate.  news conference tomorrow at 11:00 a. m. four more years of weakness with a crooked hillary administration is not acceptable.  look what has happened to the world with o & hillary! #nevertrump is never more.  they were crushed last night in cleveland at rules committee by a vote of 87-12.  make america great again! my prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in nice, france.  we are with you in every way! in light of the horrible attack in nice, france, i have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my vice presidential announcement. another horrific attack, this time in nice, france.  many dead and injured.  when will we learn?  it is only getting worse. i employ many people in the state of virginia - jobs, jobs, jobs!  crooked hillary will sell us out, just like her husband did with nafta. another new poll.  thank you for your support!  join the movement today!  #imwithyou   new poll- thank you america! #trump2016 #imwithyou  will be making the announcement of my vice presidential pick on friday at 11am in manhattan.  details to follow. if i win the presidency, we will swamp justice ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions! even the @nytimes and @washingtonpost editorial boards condemned justice ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach.  what was she thinking? is supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct?  big mistake by an incompetent judge! on my way to san diego to raise money for the republican party.  i am spending a lot myself and also helping others. voters understand that crooked hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity. despite spending $500k a day on tv ads alone #crookedhillary falls flat in nationwide @quinnipiacpoll.  having zero impact.  sad! ! lyin' crooked hillary's email stories all have one thing in common.   president obama trying to destroy israel with all his bad moves?  think about it and let me know! the republican platform is most pro-israel of all time! new gop platform now includes language that supports the border wall.  we will build the wall and make america safe again! #crookedhillary is outspending me by a combined 31 to 1 in florida, ohio, & pennsylvania.  i haven't started yet!   you florida, ohio, and pennsylvania!  #crookedhillary is not qualified.  #imwithyou  you!  #imwithyou  ginsburg of the u. s.  supreme court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.  her mind is shot - resign! thank you indiana!  #trump2016  you iowa- see you soon! #trump2016 #imwithyou   will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @foxnews at 8pm.  enjoy! the american people agree.  no free pass for #crookedhillary!   all the bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests, we welcome you with open arms.  people first. bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-tpp pro-wall street crooked hillary clinton. bernie sanders endorsing crooked hillary clinton is like occupy wall street endorsing goldman sachs. #crookedhillary is not qualified!  am somewhat surprised that bernie sanders was not true to himself and his supporters.  they are not happy that he is selling out! bernie sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to crooked hillary clinton.  he will endorse her today - fans angry! this election is a choice between law, order & safety - or chaos, crime & violence.  i will make america safe again for everyone.  #imwithyoufor too many years, our inner cities have been left behind.  i am going to deliver jobs, safety and protection for those in need. crime is out of control, and rapidly getting worse.  look what is going on in chicago and our inner cities.  not good! #makeamericagreatagain #imwithyou  united states district judge robert e.  payne today ruled in favor of trump c delegates who had argued. .  on veterans' reform: poll- florida!  thank you!   and prayers with the victims, and their families- along with everyone at the berrien county courthouse in st.  joseph, michigan. join me in westfield, indiana- tomorrow night at 7:30pm!  #trump2016 tickets:   heard that the underachieving john king of @cnn on inside politics was one hour of lies.  happily, few people are watching - dead network! the media is so dishonest.  if i make a statement, they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish. they think the public is stupid! president obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think.  he is living in a world of the make believe! look what is happening to our country under the weak leadership of obama and people like crooked hillary clinton.  we are a divided nation! new poll - thank you!  #trump2016  to go @serenawilliams  - you are a true ch proud of you! make america safe again!   it sad that on a day of national tragedy hillary clinton is answering softball questions about her email lies on @cnn? due to the horrific events taking place in our country, i have decided to postpone my speech on economic opportunity- today in miami. last night's horrific execution-style shootings of 12 dallas law enforcement officers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our countryafter today, crooked hillary can officially be called lyin' crooked hillary. thank you speaker @pryan! #americafirst #trump2016     you rep.  collins!  #trump2016  leaving d. c.  had great meetings with republicans in the house and senate.  very interesting day!  these are people who love our country! great being in cincinnati, ohio last night- thank you!  off to washington d. c.  now.  #trump2016 #americafirst  is the outrage for this disney book?  is this the 'star of david' also?  dishonest media!  #frozen  all of my twitter followers, please contribute whatever you can to the c we must beat crooked hillary.   speaker schedule to be released tomorrow.  let today be devoted to crooked hillary and the rigged system under which we live. i have over seven million hits on social media re crooked hillary clinton.  check it out sleepy eyes, @markhalperin @nbcpoliticssleepy eyes chuck todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again. he could not have watched my standing ovation speech in n. c. even the once great caesars is bankrupt in a. c.  others to follow.  ask the democrat city council what happened to atlantic city. hillary clinton should ask why the democrat pols in atlantic city made all the wrong moves - convention center, airport - and destroyed cityi made a lot of money in atlantic city and left 7 years ago, great timing as all know.  pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies. crooked hillary clinton lied to the fbi and to the people of our country.  she is sooooo guilty.  but watch, her time will come! the rigged system may have helped hillary clinton escape criminal charges, but  hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement. crooked hillary clinton and her team were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.  not fit! crooked hillary clinton is unfit to serve as president of the u. s.  her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong.  bad judgement! i don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed crooked hillary to get away with murder.  come november 8, she's out! raised a lot of money for the republican party.  there will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning.  lots of support!  wini will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @foxnews at 11pm.  enjoy! my son, @erictrump will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10pm on @foxnews.  enjoy! looking forward to meeting with @senbobcorker in a little while.  we will be traveling to north carolina together today. fbi director said crooked hillary compromised our national security.  no charges.  wow!  #riggedsystemthe system is rigged.  general petraeus got in trouble for far less.  very very unfair!  as usual, bad judgment. it was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday.  she has done a fantastic job for the people of iowa and u. s.  will see her again! taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of air force one on the c trail by president obama and crooked hillary.  a total disgrace! on @foxnews at 7:00 p. m.  special: meet the trumps hope you enjoy! why is president obama allowed to use air force one on the c trail with crooked hillary?  she is flying with him tomorrow.  who pays? with hillary and obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse.  politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - radical islam! crooked hillary clinton is guilty as hell but the system is totally rigged and corrupt!  where are the 33,000 missing e-mails? the only people who are not interested in being the v. p.  pick are the people who have not been asked! i look forward to meeting @joniernst today in new jersey.  she has done a great job as senator of iowa! spent time with indiana governor mike pence and family yesterday.  very impressed, great people! senator tom cotton was great on meet the press yesterday.  despite a totally one-sided interview by chuck todd, the end result was solid! dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the star of david rather than a sheriff's star, or plain star! happy 4th of july!  #trump2016 #americafirst   hillary will never be able to handle the complexities and danger of isis - it will just go on forever.  we need change! the third mass attack slaughter in days by isis.  200 dead in baghdad, worst in many years.  we do not have leadership that can stop this! in bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by isis terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the koran.  20 were killed! i believe that crooked hillary sent bill to have the meeting with the u. s. a. g.  so bill is not in trouble with h except that he got caught! the secret meeting between bill clinton and the u. s. a. g.  in back of closed plane was heightened with fbi shouting go away, no pictures. does anybody really believe that bill clinton and the u. s. a. g.  talked only about grandkids and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac? the system is rigged! on saturday a great man, elie wiesel, passed away. the world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil! crooked hillary clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the u. s. a. g.  to work out a deal.  the system is totally rigged & corrupt! only a fool would believe that the meeting between bill clinton and the u. s. a. g.  was not arranged or that crooked hillary did not know. just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me chuck todd, and the entire show, is against me. the good news-the people get it! it was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against crooked hillary clinton.  like i said, the system is totally rigged! it is impossible for the fbi not to recommend criminal charges against hillary clinton.  what she did was wrong!  what bill did was stupid! thank you @greta.  #imwithyou  you for your support! #americafirst #leadright2016   @gop: reminder: last year, clinton pledged she had turned over all work-related email under penalty of perjury ‚¨áÔ∏è  you!  #americafirst  i become the next potus- they will not be ignoring!  #americafirst  hillary -- makes history!  #imwithyou #americafirst  #2a to our constitution is clear.  the right of the people to keep & bear arms shall not be infringed upon.   #imwithyou  speakers slots at the republican convention are totally filled, with a long waiting list of those that want to speak - wednesday releasejust read in the failing @nytimes that i was not aware the event had to be held in cleveland - a total lie.  these people are sick! when you can't say it - or see it -- you can't fix it.  we will make america safe again!  #imwithyou #americafirst  returned from colorado.  amazing crowd! thank you for inviting me to the western conservative summit in colorado!  #imwithyou #wcs16   you for your support!  we will make america safe and great again!  #imwithyou #americafirst  crimes won't be happening if i'm elected potus.  killer should have never been here.  #americafirst  another terrorist attack today in israel -- a father, shot at by a palestinian terrorist, was killed while: killing of a 13 year old american girl at her home in israel by a palestinian terrorist.  we must get tough.   great job on fox this morning.  keep up the good work! take a look at what happened w/ bill clinton.  the system is totally rigged.  does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence? bill clinton's meeting was a total secret.  nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter. as bernie sanders said, hillary clinton has bad judgement.  bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by hillary! #throwbackthursday #trump2016 will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10pm on fox!  enjoy! the reason i put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary c is very simple, i want to make america great again! i have self funded my winning primary c with an approx.  $50 million loan.  i have totally terminated the loan! the very dishonest @nbcnews refuses to accept the fact that i have forgiven my $50 million loan to my c done deal! one of the reasons hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out america.   would college graduates want crooked hillary as their president?  she will destroy them!   book by @ericbolling is absolutely terrific and a must read!  #wakeupamericathe story with hillary will never change.   @drudge_report: 43-39  reasons only they can explain, the @uschamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better. tremendous day in massachusetts and maine.  thank you to everyone for making it so special! @gengm7: @jakeda @realdonaldtrump as of april this year, hillary had spent $264,000,000 on her c mr. trump $55,000,000.  self fundingi will be on @oreillyfactor at 8:00 p. m.  enjoy! isis exploded on hillary clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will.  not capable! will be in bangor, maine today!  join me- 4pme at the cross insurance center!    q poll out- we are going to win the whole deal- and make america great again!  #trump2016  watched senator john barrasso on @foxnews - he was great!  thank you john. why would the uschamber be upset by the fact that i want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that i want penalties for cheaters? the @uschamber must fight harder for the american worker.  china, and many others, are taking advantage of u. s.  with our terrible trade pactsiron mike tyson was not asked to speak at the convention though i'm sure he would do a good job if he was.  the media makes everything up! @jtsbk:  @allenwest thanks for sharing eric we need @realdonaldtrump now as this administration is incapable of keeping our country safewe must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the united states. yet another terrorist attack, this time in turkey.  willthe world ever realize what is going on?  so sad. hillary clinton‚Äôs presidency would be catastrophic forthe future of our country.  she is ill-fit with bad judgment. benghazi is just another hillary clinton failure.  it justnever seems to work the way it's supposed to with clinton. check it out - 2nd video on lying crooked hillary is now online!  watch it here:  #crookedhillary #trump2016@kridan1: canceled cable - sick of their bad coverage of you and the fawning over clinton  listened to your great speech on youtube@bluedogdemky: @cwaunion @iowa_trump @richardtrumka @aflcio this is why i would think the unions would support @realdonaldtrump for #potus@arnold_ziffel: @anncoulter also can't help but notice the stock market's reaction as @realdonaldtrump was speaking.  #upupup@patricia_graf:  @govbrewer @cvpayne let's get trump supporters out in massive numbers and make america great again - create jobs@vegas_sports: good for @realdonaldtrump he's smart on business.  maybe if corporations weren't overtaxed they would stay.  voting for #trump@govbrewer: i'll be a guest today on making money with @cvpayne on @ fox business 6 pm et / 3 pm pt discussing @realdonaldtrump.  tune in! . @cnn is all negative when it comes to me.  i don't watch it anymore. the media is unrelenting.  they will only go with and report a story in a negative light.  i called brexit hillary was wrong, watch novembercrooked hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the u. s.  senate, goofy elizabeth warren, who lied on heritage. @lindasuhler: trump voters don't scare or back down.  our numbers are growing & we're taking our country back.  #trump2016üá∫üá∏ #maga@w4djt: under a trump presidency, america will make brilliant new trade deals!  ‚Äîdonald trump #dtmag  hillary read sigh off the teleprompter, she's so fake she has to be told how to feel:  @foxnews@jimvitari:  @abc @washingtonpost we know they're fake just like poles during primary.  i'm sure u will crush #crookedhillary in generalthe dirty poll done by @abc @washingtonpost is a disgrace.  even they admit that many more democrats were polled.  other polls were good. crooked hillary attacks foreign government donations - while ignoring her own:  hillary clinton got brexit wrong.  i said leave will win.  she has no sense of markets and such bad judgement.  only a question of timehillary clinton is not a change agent, just the same old status quo!  she is spending a fortune, i am spending very little.  close in polls! people in our country want borders, and without them the old line pols like crooked hillary will not win.  it is time for change -- and jobs! top 50 facts about crooked hillary clinton from trump 'stakes of the election' address:  @abc poll s is heavy on democrats.   very dishonest - why would they do that?  other polls good! crooked hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at turnberry.  shows me hitting shot, but i never did = lie!  was there to support sonclinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on brexit with big dollar ads.  disgraceful! crooked hillary clinton, who called brexit 100% wrong along with obama, is now spending wall street money on an ad on my correct call. george will, one of the most overrated political pundits who lost his way long ago, has left the republican party. he's made many bad callsjust landed in new york - a one night stay in scotland.  turnberry came out magnificently.  my son, eric, did a great job - under budget! obama has blocked ice officers and bp from doing their jobs.  that ends when i am president! i have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' -- but we must enforce the laws of the land! we only want to admit those who love our people and support our values.  #americafirstwe must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place. thank you to everyone who came out & joined us @trumpturnberry yesterday!  @erictrump @ivankatrump @donaldjtrumpjr  the 13th tee box @trumpscotland with my grand daughter, kai!  @donaldjtrumpjr  @trumpscotland with @donaldjtrumpjr & @erictrump.  back to new york tonight.  video:  funny, crooked hillary called brexit so incorrectly, and now she says that she is the one to deal with the u. k.  all talk, no action!

the opening of trump turnberry in scotland was a big success.  good timing, i was here for brexit.  very exciting news conference today! crooked hillary called it totally wrong on brexit - she went with obama - and now she is saying we need her to lead.  she would be a disasteri want all americans to succeed together.  president obama's illegal executive amnesty undermines job prospects for government data by the center for immigration studies shows more than 3m new legal & illegal immigrants settled. .  is proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder w/a free & ind uk.  we stand together as friends, as allies, & as a people w/a shared history. self-determination is the sacred right of all free people's, and the people of the uk have exercised that right for all the world to see. getting ready to open the magnificent turnberry in scotland.  what a great day, especially when added to the brave & brilliant vote. statement regarding british referendum on e. u.  membership arrived in scotland.  place is going wild over the vote.  they took their country back, just like we will take america back.  no games! congratulations to my son, eric, on the fantastic job he has done in rebuilding turnberry, and its great ailsa course.  always support kids! leaving now for a one night trip to scotland in order to be at the grand opening of my great turnberry resort.  will be back on sat.  night! meet the amazing mother whose letter i read during my speech.  she lost her son to policies supported by clinton.   my full statement here on the supreme court's executive amnesty decision #imwithyou  is another cnn lie.  the clinton news network is losing all credibility.  i‚Äôm not watching it much anymore.    which is totally biased in favor of clinton, should apologize.  they knew they were wrong.    @scottadamssays: trump's speech today is the best persuasion i have ever seen.  game over.  now running unopposed:   inner cities have been left behind.  we will never have the resources to support our people if we have an open border. on immigration, i‚Äôm consulting with our immigration officers& our wage-earners.  hillary clinton is consulting with wall street. obama & clinton should stop meeting with special interests, & start meeting with the victims of illegal immigration. hillary clinton‚Äôs open borders are tearing american families apart.  i am going to make our country safe again for all americans.  #imwithyousc has kept us safe from exec amnesty--for now.  but hillary has pledged to expand it, taking jobs from hispanic & african-american workers. rt @foxbusiness: . @jerryjrfalwell: i was so impressed by [@realdonaldtrump's] speech yesterday.  he was the best i've ever seen him.   lies to benghazi families#crookedhillary  threatens us today because of the decisions hillary clinton has made along with president obama.   --  donald j.  trumphillary clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.   --   donald j.  trumpthank you to donald rumsfeld for the endorsement.  very much appreciated.  clinton's conduct has been disqualifying. @allegrettivicki: you have great children, future presidentsand we all see were raised right and out there for their father.  thank you. @1lion: brilliant 3 word response to hillary's 'i'm with you'  slogan  @realdonaldtrump  @realdonaldtrump great speech today! !  it's all about america and that's why you will become president! ! ! !   thank you. #imwithyou    says things can't change.  i say they have to change.  it's a choice between americanism and her corrupt globalism.  #imwithyou@chrisboydbrew: @loudobbs @realdonaldtrump @foxbusiness. .  saw your interview. you are the best!  great questions, great answers lou is greatcrooked hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief!  she will be a disaster for jobs and the economy! i will be interviewed by @loudobbs tonight on @foxbusiness 7pm ethillary defrauded america as secy of state.  she used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich!  corrupt, dangerous, dishonest. if you want to know about hillary clinton's honesty & judgment, ask the family of ambassador stevens. hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays. i am the king of debt. that has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country.  i made a fortune off of debt, will fix u. s. obama-clinton inherited $10t in debt and turned it into nearly $20t.   they have bankrupted‚Ä¶  clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all americans - and make everyone less safe. how can hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk? hillary clinton surged the trade deficit with china 40% assecretary of state, costing americans millions of jobs. hillary says this election is about judgment.   she's right.   her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed isis and wrecked the economy. i will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of crooked hillary clinton. crooked hillary clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess! when i said that if, within the orlando club, you had some people with guns, i was obviously talking about additional guards or employees. @djohnsonpga we are so proud of you dustin.  your reaction under pressure was amazing.  first of many majors.  you are a true ch watch out hillaryclinton üëø support @realdonaldtrump üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá∏ #makeamericagreatagain üá∫üá∏  failing @nytimes fraudulently shows an empty room prior to my speech, when in fact, it was packed!

what has happened in orlando is just the beginning.  our leadership is weak and ineffective.  i called it and asked for the ban.  must be tough@wandawalls20: @realdonaldtrump please make us safe.  we cannot have hillary as president.  we will be in so much trouble. reporting that orlando killer shouted allah hu akbar!  as he slaughtered clubgoers.  2nd man arrested in la with rifles near gay parade. is president obama going to finally mention the words radical islamic terrorism?  if he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace! appreciate the congrats for being right on radical islamic terrorism, i don't want congrats, i want toughness & vigilance.  we must be smart! horrific incident in fl.  praying for all the victims & their families.  when will this stop?  when will we get tough, smart & vigilant? clinton made a false ad about me where i was imitating a reporter groveling after he changed his story.  i would never mock disabled.  shame! really bad shooting in orlando.  police investigating possible terrorism.  many people dead and wounded. goofy elizabeth warren, sometimes referred to as pocahontas, pretended to be a native american in order to advance her career.  very racist!

a former secret service agent for president clinton excoriates crooked hillary describing her as erratic & violent.  bad temperament for pressee, when i said nato was obsolete because of no terrorism protection, they made the change without giving me credit.  @ivankatrump: my next project is pretty amazing‚Ä¶! xx, ivanka   you diamond and silk!   the fallen heroes on #dday - june 6, 1944.   am getting bad marks from certain pundits because i have a small c staff.  but small is good, flexible, save money and number one! a massive blow to obama's message - only 38,000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report.  that's really bad! crooked hillary is being badly criticized for a wall street paid for ad by politifact for a false ad on me on women.  she is a total fraud! crooked hillary clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months.  her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions! just like i have been able to spend far less money than  others on the c and finish #1, so too should our country.  we can be great! people like @katyturnbc report on my c but have zero access.  they say what they want without any knowledge. true of so much of media! hillary clinton is unfit to be president.  she has bad judgement, poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record.  change!

 she doesn't even look presidential! crooked hillary no longer has credibility - too much failure in office.  people will not allow another four years of incompetence! crooked hillary clinton, who i would love to call lyin' hillary, is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions. after the litigation is disposed of and the case won, i have instructed my execs to open trump u? , so much interest in it!  i will be pres. even though i have a very biased and unfair judge in the trump u civil case in san diego, i have thousands of great reviews & will win case! with all of the crooked hillary clinton's foreign policy experience, she has made so many mistakes - and i mean real monsters!

join me in sacramento, california-tomorrow evening @ 7pm!  #trump2016  many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money i raised/gave!  it was my great honor - they do an amazing job. just finished a press conference in trump tower wherein i gave information on which veterans groups got the $5,600,000 that i raised/gave! i have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great veterans, and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so.  watch! so many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good!  news conference at 11:00 a. m.  today, trump tower! i should have easily won the trump university case on summary judgement but have a judge, gonzalo curiel, who is totally biased against me. i have a judge in the trump university civil case, gonzalo curiel san diego, who is very unfair.  an obama pick.  totally biased-hates trumpi hope everyone had a great memorial day! i would have had millions of votes more in the primaries than crooked hillary if i only had one opponent, instead of sixteen.  broke recordhave a great memorial day and remember that we will soon make america great again! @nbcdfw: trump rallies veterans at annual rolling thunder gathering   how many of donald's rolling thunder brigade will sign up and go to war for him in the middle east. @mariaernandez3b: trump supports rolling thunder rally #trump strong  so true, and remember the m. i. a. 's! @scottwrasmussen: donald trump and bikers share affection at rolling thunder rally  a great day in d. c. ! @teapartynevada: #trump2016 illegals are taken care of better than our veterans.     endorsement of me by the 16,500 border patrol agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate.  nice! in getting the endorsement of the 16,500 border patrol agents thank you, the statement was made that the wall was very necessary! obama says a wall at our southern border won't enhance our security wrong and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall fence at w. h. if dummy bill kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an independent, say good bye to the supreme court! the republican party has to be smart & strong if it wants to win in november.  can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler indie candidate! bill kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser, but if the gop can't control their own, then they are not a party.  be tough, r's! good news is that my c has perhaps more cash than any c in the history of politics- b/c i stand 100% behind everything we do. heading to d. c.  to see and hear rolling thunder.  amazing people that love our country.  great spirit! honor memorial day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country!  we love them. does president obama ever discuss the sneak attack on pearl harbor while he's in japan?  thousands of american lives lost.  #mdwdon't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my c the only quote that matters is a quote from me! i am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes, but when i won the gop nomination, i'm in the back of the paper.  very dishonest! the media is on a new phony kick about my management style.  i spend much less money & get much better results!  what we need as prez! the failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style & that i don't have many people.  i have 73, hillary has 800- & i'm beating her. i we broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a republican primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go!

i just released my financial disclosure forms, the largest numbers in the history of the f. e. c.  even the dishonest media thinks great! amazingly, with all of the money i have raised for the vets, i have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media. much of the money i have raised for our veterans has already been distributed, with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups. while under no obligation to do so, i have raised between 5 & 6 million dollars, including 1million dollars from me, for our veterans.  nice!

bernie sanders is continuing his quest because he believes that crooked hillary clinton will be forced out of the race - e-mail scandal! join me on wednesday, may 25th at the anaheim convention center! #trump2016 #maga tickets:   hillary wants a radical 500% increase in syrian refugees.  we can‚Äôt allow this.  time to get smart and protect america! how can crooked hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical islam, which horribly oppresses women? rt @gatewaypundit: breaking poll: trump gains 11 points on clinton since march=&gt; now leads crooked hillary 46-44  vi‚Ä¶why do the networks continue to put dopey @billkristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs? hillary clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad!  would be four more years of stupidity! crooked hillary said that i  want guns brought into the school classroom.  wrong! @dubilujane: i trust @realdonaldtrump more anyone ever to protect america. he will do the right thing for the u. s. a, without a  doubt. thank you to all of the men and women who have served our country.  you are our true heroes!  #armedforcesday  hillary clintons foreign interventions unleashed isis in syria, iraq and libya.  she is reckless and dangerous! make america great again!   is so negative, getting even worse as i get closer.  just had two anti-trump losers with zero rebuttal from my team.  turning off! @rbacliff: hillary wants to rip the guns out of america's hands.  no guns = no protection.  get on #trumptrain & join @nra to stop her. crooked hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed.  no more guns to protect hillary! while our wonderful president was out playing golf all day, the tsa is falling apart, just like our government!  airports a total disaster! crooked hillary is spending tremendous amounts of wall street money on false ads against me.  she is a very dishonest person! crooked hillary clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment.  no gun owner can ever vote for clinton! thank you @thetodaysgolfer for the wonderful statement that the new par 3 9th hole @trump turnberry could be the most dramatic in britain. @montgomeriefdn  colin, great to have you at trump turnberry.  so proud of you and your great playing!  you made winning majors look easy! @montgomeriefdn: @trumpturnberry best links course in britain.  ailsa course opens june '16 can't wait to play it  you for your wonderful endorsement today @tgowdysc.  it means a great deal to me.  we will not disappoint!  #trump2016great day in kentucky with wayne lapierre, chris cox & the @nra!  #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016  you!  an honor to be the first candidate ever endorsed by the @nra- prior to @gopconvention!  #trump2016 #2a   @nytimes will always take a good story about me and make it bad.  every article is unfair and biased.  very sad! thanks @piersmorgan!  trump is the most unpredictable, extraordinary, entertaining& popular candidate this country has ever seen. crooked hillary clinton- discussing the #secondamendment at a private event.  #2a cc: @nra  am on my way!  see you all soon!   call for unity by jason greenblatt @jasondovesq  hillary can't even close the deal with bernie - and the dems have it rigged in favor of hillary.  four more years of this?  no way! crooked hillary clinton looks presidential?  i don't think so!  four more years of obama and our country will never come back.  isis laughs! look where the world is today, a total mess, and isis is still running around wild.  i can fix it fast, hillary has no chance! crooked hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina.  isis, china, russia and all would love for her to be president.  4 more years! i said that crooked hillary clinton is not qualified to be president because she has very bad judgement - bernie said the same thing! thank you @ltstevenlrogers.  we will respond to terrorism with strength in 2017!  quality a woman is rowanne brewer lane to have exposed the @nytimes as a disgusting fraud?   thank you rowanne. looks like yet another terrorist attack.  airplane departed from paris.  when will we get tough, smart and vigilant?  great hate and sickness! my list of potential u. s.  supreme court justices was very well recieved.  during the next number of weeks i may be adding to the list! some low-life journalist claims that i made a pass at her 29 years ago.  never happened!  like the @nytimes story which has become a joke! #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016  you louisiana!  #trump2016  you arizona!  see you soon! #makeamericagreatagain  did clinton supporter @alisonforky declare crooked hillary winner in ky when ap hasn't even called the race? bernie sanders is being treated very badly by the democrats - the system is rigged against him.  many of his disenfranchised fans are for me! paul begala, the dopey @cnn flunky and head of the pro-hillary clinton super pac, has knowingly committed fraud in his first ad against me. @shoneep: @realdonaldtrump trump for president!  bernie is a joke, knows nothing - and hillary is yesterday's and today's nightmare@magicmetalninja:  the trump movement will not be stopped.  we support trump because he is a true american looking out for #americafirst. congratulations to the movement, we have just won the great state of oregon.  the vote percentage is even higher than anticipated!

 enjoy! wall street paid for ad is a fraud, just like crooked hillary!  their main line had nothing to do with women, and they knew it.  apologize? do you think crooked hillary will finally close the deal?  if she can't win kentucky, she should drop out of race.  system rigged! i will be live tweeting my interview with @megynkelly on the fox network tonight at 8!  enjoy!   look forward to watching @megynkelly tonight, 8 pm et.  it will be interesting to see how she treats me‚Äîi think she will be very fair. how can crooked hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for nafta, the worst economic deal in u. s.  history? crooked hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy. if so, he should run,not her. will he bring the energizer to d. c. ? #votetrump at clerk's offices & 185 ballot drop boxes in #orprimary! closes at 8pm!   hillary can't close the deal with bernie sanders.  will be another bad day for her! amazing that crooked hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the worst abuser of woman in u. s.  political historyoregon is voting today.  keep the big numbers going - vote trump!  make america great again! crooked hillary clinton put out an ad where i am misquoted on women.  can't believe she would misrepresent the facts!  my hit was on chinathe pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line.  you can tell them to go blank themselves - was about china, not women! wow, 30,000 e-mails were deleted by crooked hillary clinton.  she said they had to do with a wedding reception.  liar!  how can she run? @aprillajune: oregon votes today!  go vote for @realdonaldtrump and kick it big time!   barbara res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly, and for years, trying to come back.  i said no. i gave a woman named barbara res a top n. y.  construction job, when that was unheard of, and now she is nasty.  so much for a nice thank you! in politics, and in life, ignorance is not a virtue.  this is a primary reason that president obama is the worst president in u. s.  history! the writer of the now proven false story in the @nytimes, michael barbaro, who was interviewed on cbs this morning, was unable to respond. over 50 women were interviewed by the @nytimes yet they only wrote about 6.  that‚Äôs because there were so many positive statements. no wonder the @nytimes is failing‚Äîwho can believe what they write after the false, malicious & libelous story they did on me. the failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women. rowanne brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday joined @foxandfriends.   you, anthony @scaramucci @wsj the entrepreneur's case for trump   the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing @nytimes hit piece on me, we have exposed the article as a fraud! a political commentator for @cnn, which i no longer watch, said trump showed some weakness in the repub primaries.  i set all-time record! wow, rowanne brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday, was on @foxandfriends saying times liedthe @nytimes is so dishonest.  their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by rowanne brewer, who said it was a lie! that was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends - i hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is! bernie sanders is being treated very badly by the dems.  the system is rigged against him.  he should run as an independent!  run bernie, run. great new poll- thank you! #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016  @washingtonpost report on potential vp candidates is wrong.  marco rubio and most others mentioned are not under consideration. thank you georgia!  see you soon! #trump2016  media is really on a witch-hunt against me.  false reporting, and plenty of it - but we will prevail! why did the failing @nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that i was so proud to have helped with their careers.  dishonest! wow, i have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing @nytimes piece.  massive front page for that! why doesn't the failing @nytimes write the real story on the clintons and women?  the media is totally dishonest! @takingit_back:  @nytimes keep shining. the ppl will not let the media dim your lightwe no longer believe them!  #trump2016 thanks. @tzard000: @realdonaldtrump @nytimes everyone continues to pile onto donald, but they can never take away our votes!   thank you! everyone is laughing at the @nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and women. i gave them many names of women i helped-refused to use@distlerjoyce: @realdonaldtrump @nytimes ohio women for trump  leicester & donaldtrump seem to have the same trajectory, both were written off, but they keep scaling the heights.  history? @queencharlotteo: @realdonaldtrump @nytimes i'm a women & i 100% support @realdonaldtrump & i have since the beginning.  thank you! the failing @nytimes wrote yet another hit piece on me.  all are impressed with how nicely i have treated women, they found nothing.  a joke! thank you for the nice words this morning @kellyriddell.  well delivered and totally logical!  @cnn   @foxnews@stranahan: sheldon adelson pledges $100 million to elect trump president - breitbart  @cnn is really working hard to make me look as bad  as possible.  very unprofessional.  hurting in ratings - bad television! great new poll- thank you!   crooked hillary clinton can't close the deal on crazy bernie, how is she going to take on china, russia, isis and all of the others? an incredible honor to receive the endorsement of a person ihave such tremendous respect for.  thank you, sheldon!    your story about me & the carbon tax is absolutely incorrect‚Äîit is just the opposite.  i will not support or endorse a carbon tax! senator lindsey graham called me yesterday, very much to my surprise, and we had a very interesting talk about national security, and more! great meeting with @senatemajldr mitch mcconnell and republican leaders in d. c.  #trump2016  day in d. c.  with @speakerryan and republican leadership.  things working out really well!  #trump2016  it were up to goofy elizabeth warren, we‚Äôd have no jobs in america‚Äîshe doesn‚Äôt have a clue. in interview i told @ap that my taxes are under routine audit and i would release my tax returns when audit is complete, not after election! isn‚Äôt it funny when a failed senator like goofy elizabeth warren can spend a whole day tweeting about trump & gets nothing done in senate? goofy elizabeth warren lied when she says i want to abolish the federal minimum wage.  see media‚Äîasking for increase! our native american senator, goofy elizabeth warren, couldn‚Äôt care less about the american worker‚Ä¶does nothing to help! goofy elizabeth warren is now using the woman‚Äôs card like her friend crooked hillary.  see her dumb tweet ‚Äúwhen a woman stands up to you‚Ä¶‚Äùif the people of massachusetts found out what an ineffective senator goofy elizabeth warren has been, she would lose! thanks piers.   #trump2016  elizabeth warren didn‚Äôt have the guts to run for potus.  her phony native american heritage stops that and vp cold. goofy elizabeth warren has been one of the least effective senators in the entire u. s.  senate.  she has done nothing! i don't want to hit crazy bernie sanders too hard yet because i love watching what he is doing to crooked hillary.  his time will come! big wins in west virginia and nebraska.  get ready for november - crooked hillary, who is looking very bad against crazy bernie, will lose! thank you nebraska! #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016  you west virginia! #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016  @danscavino: louisiana general electiondonald trump vs.  hillary clinton#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016  @danscavino: ohio general electiondonald trump vs.  hillary clinton#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016  clintons spend millions on negative ads on me & i can‚Äôt tell the truth about her husband?  don‚Äôt feel sorry for crooked hillary!

 @marthamaccallumwhy does the media, with a strong push from crooked hillary, keep pushing the false narrative that i want to raise taxes.  exactly opposite! .  #repmikekelly  great job on @foxandfriends this morning.  thank you for the nice words!

. @edgoeas thank you for your support tonight on @judgejeanine. remember when the two failed presidential candidates, lindsey graham and jeb bush, signed a binding pledge?  they broke the deal, no honor! i am honored that the great men and women of the @teamsters have created a movement from within called teamsters for trump!  thank you. i am going to keep our jobs in the u. s. , and totally rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.  crooked hillary has no clue!  @teamstersjoin me in washington today! spokane tickets:lynden tickets:  elizabeth warren is weak and ineffective.  does nothing.  all talk, no action -- maybe her native american name? goofy elizabeth warren and her phony native american heritage are on a twitter rant.  she is too easy!  i'm driving her nuts. crooked hillary clinton wants completely open borders.  millions of democrats will run from her over this and support me. just met with courageous family of sarah root in nebraska.  sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy. goofy elizabeth warren, hillary clinton‚Äôs flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie.  she is not native american. let‚Äôs properly check goofy elizabeth warren‚Äôs records to see if she is native american.  i say she‚Äôs a fraud! i hope corrupt hillary clinton chooses goofy elizabeth warren as her running mate.  i will defeat them both. response to @lindseygrahamsc: hear @joenbc of rapidly fading @morning_joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run.  this will guarantee a crooked hillary win. joe scarborough initially endorsed jeb bush and jeb crashed, then john kasich and that didn't work.  not much power or insight! thank you to teachers across america!  when i become potus we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now. crooked hillary has zero leadership ability.  as bernie sanders says, she has bad judgement.  constantly playing the women's card - it is sad! paul ryan said that i inherited something very special, the republican party.  wrong, i didn't inherit it, i won it with millions of voters! @ausbiz:  many would say that you are the only talented person running for the top job this time!  #makeamericagreatagain #trumptrainso many great endorsements yesterday, except for paul ryan!  we must put america first and make america great again! governor rick perry said donald trump is one of the most talented people running for the presidency i've ever seen.  thank you rick!

kasich just announced that he wants the people of indiana to vote for him.  typical politician - can't make a deal work. shows how weak and desperate lyin' ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses. lyin' ted cruz and 1 for 38 kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up collusion in a two on one.  shows weakness! lyin' ted and kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate.  their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them.  sad! wow, just announced that lyin' ted and kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the republican nomination.  desperation! i am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing.  it is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down.  becoming irrelevant! @diamondandsilk: . @donaldjtrumpjr awesome job on @cnnsotu.  donaldtrump has integrity & he refuses 2 play the game call delegate bribery@newtgingrich: #nyprimary turned trump from frontrunner into presumptive #gop nominee   will be in maryland this afternoon for a major rally.  things are looking good for tuesday!

 this is a movement! #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016 met prince on numerous occasions.  he was an amazing talent and wonderful guy.  he will be greatly missed! cruz said kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237.  now he can't get to 1237.  drop out lyin' ted. both ted cruz and john kasich have no path to victory.  they should both drop out of the race so that the republican party can unify! senator ted cruz has been mathematically eliminated from race.  he said kasich should get out for same reason.  i think both should get out! i will be doing the @todayshow with my wife, melania, and the rest of my family in a major town hall.  hopefully, it will be fun!
