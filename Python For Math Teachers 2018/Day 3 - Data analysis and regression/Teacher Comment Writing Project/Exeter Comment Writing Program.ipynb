I felt like I did good job understanding the big picture concepts of calculus which is why I got a satisfactory score on the final. I felt like the AP went well, we'll see how I really did in July. The reason this class was so challenging for me was because I jumped from pre-calc which was not challenging at all straight into calculus AB which was one of the most difficult courses for me that I've ever had. However, I felt like once I started meeting with Lauren outside of class, it was easier to grasp the material. In college, I plan to take math, but I'm not sure what class I'll be put in. ' \n",

However, with extra help outside of class, it became one of my strongest sections on the final and the AP (I think). I’ve also had some troubles with u-sub that have improved a lot through test review. I think that these problems came as a result of falling behind early on in the quarter (from missing class, etc) and never really getting my feet back under me until the final review. I’m definitely happy with how I performed on the final in terms of remembering things from earlier in the year, but I made a lot of completely accidental errors that cost me some points and made me a little annoyed with myself. I hope I’ll get to take another math class at some point in the next four years– maybe something theoretical/proof based because that is what I enjoy the most.

I feel so much more comfortable with math, and have really enjoyed this course. I understood almost every lesson, and I feel confident in my skills that I have developed—not only math-wise, but my note-taking, problem-solving, and questioning skills have gotten so much better.

This shows that I do need to constantly remember the older knowledge by looking at past notes. As mentioned above, retaining the older material while learning new stuff is one of the biggest challenge, and since I wasn't coming in that much for extra help, I did end up forgetting a lot of the basics. \n",
      "On the other hand, I really enjoyed learning about how to find the volume, and the animations we did were cool. I also did like the separation of variables chapter even though I didn't do great on the test nor the re-take.

Next year I'm just taking AP Stats and I'm super excited because I heard it's a lot of fun and they're mostly real world problems which I do enjoy doing. ' \n",

Two struggles of the year for me were related rates and battling seniorities---although I'm not a senior. Second semester was busier than the first semester, and I strived to improve and maintain my grades. I talked to Lauren after class for extra help on volumes and rotations, finished the review packets for tests at least twice, and did homework on time everyday. I am satisfied with my second semester because I managed to boost my grades a lot and once I set a goal, I will work my best towards it. Before I always just tried to do as many exercise as possible, but now I learned to reflect on what I did wrong and actually improve my disadvantages. \n",
