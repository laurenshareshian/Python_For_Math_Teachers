'I feel that I retained most of the material throughout the year. It would have helped to have more time to review, though. Major challenges: overcoming senioritis (especially in semester 2) to study more for tests, and the cross-section unit. That was very hard for me to grasp. 

My highlights: I would have a lot of As and a lot of C, but not many Bs on assessments, so I'd have to say my highlights were when I did really well on certain qwests/projects. I think I took advantage of coming to see you for help when I needed it, and it always helped. I don't know what math I'll be taking in college, but I hope to get as much out of it as I can because it sets the tone for the rest of college for me.' 
 
Jill, I am pleased with your progress this semester. Your homework average is 95% which indicates that your nightly dedication has been consistent. In addition, your Gini Index on your own Leukemia and Lymphoma fundraising data was thorough and interesting. In the larger class discussion, you were typically quiet, but I could see you following along intently, and in small group work, you worked collaboratively with your classmates to problem solve. Outside of class, you stopped by my office whenever you needed extra help.
 
Your quiz average was 88%, which indicates that sometimes you need more time to absorb new content before it really sticks. You received a 92% on the Ch 4 Integration Test and an 88% on the Ch 5 Integration Test, which aligns with your self-assessment that you were comfortable with most topics.

Jane, this quarter has been challenging for you but you are persevering. Your homework average is 72% which aligns with your self assessment that you should strive for more consistency in your nightly preparations. In your Gini Index on incarcerations by type of crime, you were missing a bit of the analysis.

'This class continued to be a challenge for me during the second semester, but I got through it. I felt like I did good job understanding the big picture concepts of calculus which is why I got a satisfactory score on the final. I felt like the AP went well, we'll see how I really did in July. The reason this class was so challenging for me was because I jumped from pre-calc which was not challenging at all straight into calculus AB which was one of the most difficult courses for me that I've ever had. However, I felt like once I started meeting with Lauren outside of class, it was easier to grasp the material. In college, I plan to take math, but I'm not sure what class I'll be put in. '

With the 92 on the final, I think that I showed I understood and retained the material from the whole year quite well. I have really had some struggles with senioritis this semester, and especially this quarter, mostly in the completing homework area, but that has not really impacted my test grades much. I also think that I could have participated more actively in class, not that I never did, but I could have done more. Really the highlight for me this year was how well I did on the final exam, it was very gratifying to see that I actually did learn all this stuff. I am taking math at college but I don't know what course yet. '

Steve, in your self reflection, you wrote: 
 
'Based on the class final and the AP exam, I think I could clearly tell which material I had retained, and what I had not. In most of the problems, I either immediately knew how to do the problem, or I didn't understand it. I had to remind myself of some of the newer concepts, but overall I believe that once I really understood a topic, it didn't take too long to relearn the concepts.
One of my biggest challenges this year was rotation of solids (volumes). I had to rely on my notes way more than i would have liked, and I often had to ask my peers to repeatedly explain the concepts to me. For whatever reason, I couldn't get this unit to stick in my head like the other ones. Related rates was also difficult for me to master, but once I understood the topic, I could recall it easily. I also wish I had come in for help more during this unit and the log unit. 
Some of my highlights of this year were the very early concepts, because I felt like I understood them easily because I had an understanding of the concepts from last year's class, and was able to score really high on the exams. I also really enjoyed the Gini index project because I was able to complete it relatively easily, but I had a lot of fun making it beautiful. Next year, I believe I will be taking another calculus class because I didn't take the AP exam, and I also need it for my possible major (definitely science, which needs a math credit).'

'1. I believe that I have retained most of the second semester chapters pretty well, especially the ones that I found easier to understand. However, the first semester material that I learned was very fuzzy and I often drew a blank if I was asked to use the first semester material, especially if it was on memorizing formulas and laws/rules.

2. I found the volume extremely hard to grasp, especially since I missed a lot of classes due to tennis. There were so many formulas and rules that I had to memorize and follow as well as using my intuition. I also found all the theorems hard to apply, such as IVT, Rolles, etc... I could never remember the specific wording and which ones to use when the problem said a key word. 

3. I found the poster project really fun and interesting, because I got to choose what topic I researched and because it incorporated some studio art. It was the only part of calc that i truly looked forward in starting and working on.

4. I plan on taking another college math course if mandatory (which I think it is), but I don't know what.'

'I did not do well on the final, however, I feel like I have retained all the material we covered over the course of the year. I felt very confident taking the AP and understood how to solve almost every problem comfortably. The hardest unit for me was the one on finding volumes/cross sections that rotate around the axises etc. This was most challenging because of the complex steps as well as the number of formulas/equations that needed to be memorized. The beginning of this class was not very challenging, however, the material got harder quickly. It was really hard for me go from not having to study very much to having to work very hard to understand all the material. A highlight for me this year was realizing how much I really like math. Math has always been one of my favorite classes and this year it stood out even more. In the future I am really looking forward to taking more math classes.

To be honest, I'm not sure I'll remember all the specific details like u-sub and all that stuff but now I at least know that I have the ability to solve challenging calculus problems. My biggest challenges this year were probably separation of variables and u-sub, but eventually I understood those. This year I enjoyed how all the math we've learned in previous years was tied together so I could see that it was actually sort of important. I also feel like I began to enjoy challenging math problems a lot more than I have in the past.

The stuff we did at the beginning of the year wasn't as hard to review either because we did so much prep and practice with it. The stuff in the middle that we did for a little bit was hard for me to remember like related rates and rotation of solids. 
My biggest challenges this year was missing a lot of class in the second semester and getting used to the challenge in the first semester. During the first semester I struggled with the first two tests, but then, I was able to come up with a solution and started meeting with Lauren regularly to go over what we were learning in class and my test grades started improving. I also had to deal with missing class for golf, but I was able to meet with Lauren and stay caught up with the class. Some of the highlights from this year were how my test grades improved over the course of the year. I also enjoyed learning some of the new stuff in the second semester also. Next year, I am planning on taking AP Stats. I hope to be able to understand stats an dhow to use it to analyze data and the different purposes of it.'

'I was able to retain a decent amount of information from the first semester, and most of what I learned from the second on the AP,  although I had a harder time with the second semester course material than the first so what I retained carried less value than the first on the AP. Overall I think I did well and was able to answer all the questions. As I mentioned above, most of my troubles were in the second semester and included Integration and calculating Volume. Volume made absolutely no sense to me. Senioritis also made finding a remedy unlikely. I really liked u-sub, once I got it, I got it. I hope that I did well enough on the AP so that I don't have to take calculus in college, but if there is a teacher as great as you, Lauren, I'll be sure to take their class.'

'This has definitely been my most difficult quarter of math. I had a really hard time with differential equations, failing both the unit quest and my retaking of it. However, with extra help outside of class, it became one of my strongest sections on the final and the AP (I think). I’ve also had some troubles with u-sub that have improved a lot through test review. I think that these problems came as a result of falling behind early on in the quarter (from missing class, etc) and never really getting my feet back under me until the final review. I’m definitely happy with how I performed on the final in terms of remembering things from earlier in the year, but I made a lot of completely accidental errors that cost me some points and made me a little annoyed with myself. I hope I’ll get to take another math class at some point in the next four years– maybe something theoretical/proof based because that is what I enjoy the most. Thank you for teaching half of my high school math classes, Lauren!!'

'Based on the class final and AP exam, it does not appear that I retained the material well. However, I feel that I have a very good handle of what we learned—it was just a rough testing period. Doing the review packets and study guides I definitely felt prepared for the tests, but my really fun test anxiety and a few incredibly busy and trying weeks leading up to the AP/final gave me some not so great experiences. My personal health and problems were probably my biggest challenges, as was switching in from BC about a month or so into the school year. However, I think I have grown a lot as a student. I feel so much more comfortable with math, and have really enjoyed this course. I understood almost every lesson, and I feel confident in my skills that I have developed—not only math-wise, but my note-taking, problem-solving, and questioning skills have gotten so much better. So the highlight for me is this growth that Lauren has helped me achieve. I plan on taking Computer Science next year, and hopefully I will be able to gain a better understanding of how computers and programming work and effect our world and my future!'

 My biggest challenge was not coming in enough for extra help. Since this is my junior year and I have been really busy most of the time, I found it hard to organize my time and come in for extra help. I also find preparing myself for test a very difficult task because it requires a lot of focus and concentrating. 
  My highlight of this year is to pull off the final test successfully since it contained a lot of material and I had to study a lot from it. It was also the main factor why I felt pretty good during the AP test and pull my grade up to a B+. I think that test reflects my understanding of the material and I just needed to learn to look back on my work to check for some random mistakes.

'There were definitely some easy concepts that I forgot about (tangent line formula e.g.), but I think I had a pretty good grab on the stuff which we learned later (how to find the volume or most things we learned in the second semester). This shows that I do need to constantly remember the older knowledge by looking at past notes. As mentioned above, retaining the older material while learning new stuff is one of the biggest challenge, and since I wasn't coming in that much for extra help, I did end up forgetting a lot of the basics. 
On the other hand, I really enjoyed learning about how to find the volume, and the animations we did were cool. I also did like the separation of variables chapter even though I didn't do great on the test nor the re-take. One thing I did, especially before tests and the final, was to come in and find you during my free block and it was super helpful. Next year I'm just taking AP Stats and I'm super excited because I heard it's a lot of fun and they're mostly real world problems which I do enjoy doing. '

In this quarter, we covered Fundamental Theorems of Calculus, u-substitution, and the differentiation and integration rules involving exponential, logarithmic, and inverse trigonometric functions. In addition to two chapter tests, the students also completed a Gini Index project in which they had to analyze how equitably a resource of their choosing was distributed.

'I think the material covered over the course of the year helped me prepare for the ap exam well. Throughout the year, I worked hard by finishing my homework on time and get satisfied test scores. My biggest challenge this year is that I alway make some silly and simple mistakes. I tried to be more careful with all the problems. I am planning on taking BC cal and stats next year. I hope to hone my math skill and prepare for the ap exams in May. ' 
 
Sam, I am pleased with your progress this semester. Your homework average is 96% which indicates that your nightly dedication has been consistent. In addition, your Gini Index on earnings after graduation by college was thorough and interesting. In the larger class discussion, you were typically quiet, but I could see you following along intently, and in small group work, you worked collaboratively with your classmates to problem solve. Outside of class, you have not needed to stop by for extra help, as you have understood the topics independently.

'Comparing to last semester, I think I improved my learning skills and adjusted my way of learning math. Two struggles of the year for me were related rates and battling seniorities---although I'm not a senior. Second semester was busier than the first semester, and I strived to improve and maintain my grades. I talked to Lauren after class for extra help on volumes and rotations, finished the review packets for tests at least twice, and did homework on time everyday. I am satisfied with my second semester because I managed to boost my grades a lot and once I set a goal, I will work my best towards it. Before I always just tried to do as many exercise as possible, but now I learned to reflect on what I did wrong and actually improve my disadvantages. 
For next year, I plan to take AP statistics with Sandy or Liz. I am looking forward for taking it and I think this year's Calculus helped me build a suitable mindset for it. I hope that it will be less stressful for me but I will always be up to challenge.'
